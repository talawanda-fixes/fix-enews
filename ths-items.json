The focus of the day is on making students realize that they are not alone at Talawanda, and they have many other peers and adults that care about and support them. Our students are a large part of our community, and by sharing stories, participating in activities, and most importantly - listening - they realize the important role they play with their classmates. Since 2009, BRAVE Day has been an influential part of our Anti-bullying, personal empowerment program at THS and our students come out of this experience better people for it.The event will take place…FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 14TH The effort that our students put into the day is an amazing thing to witness. Not only do students participate, they also encourage each other throughout the day on a level that is not normally seen in a typical High School. As a School District we appreciate their willingness to let go of their normal day and try to become a better person. Talawanda is thankful for them, and realizes that we have some of the most caring students around.If you feel your student would not benefit from the day, or would be negatively affected by the activities provided, they are not required to attend. We will not force students to participate, but rather want to provide the opportunity for them to improve as Talawanda students during BRAVE Day. They should stay in class during the event if they do not want to attend.",
