I also provide small groups in which students work with their peers to learn skills that are helpful both in and out of the classroom, as well as short term one on one support. Some of the small groups and one on one support focus on specific areas such as self regulation, coping skills, relationships, etc. If you are interested in your student receiving any additional support, please complete and return the appropriate permission form.
