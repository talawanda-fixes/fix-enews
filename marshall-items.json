We go outside whenever possible, so please be sure your child has a warm coat, hat, or other layers to stay comfortable throughout the day. Mornings can be quite chilly, even if it warms up later, so sending a jacket or sweatshirt is always a good idea. Thank you for helping us keep students healthy, active, and ready to enjoy their time outside!Looking ahead, we’re excited to celebrate Halloween together next week! Our annual Halloween Parade will take place on Friday, October 31st, at 9:30 a.m. Grown-ups can drop students off as usual, then park in the upper lot and join us for some community fun before the parade begins. Enjoy free doughnuts and great conversation with other Marshall families, and grab a coffee or hot chocolate for purchase in the shelter. Everyone can head to the back lot around 9:25 to get ready for the parade kickoff. We can’t wait to see all the creative costumes and smiling faces!Sincerely,Mrs. Jones, Principal",
