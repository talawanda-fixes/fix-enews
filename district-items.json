Twenty-five individuals expressed interest and 16 submitted completed applications. We deeply appreciate the willingness of so many members of our community to step forward to help keep our district moving forward, and are grateful that we have such an impressive pool of applicants to consider.\n \nAll remaining board members have received the completed applications and are reviewing them before we meet in Special Session this coming Monday, Sep. 30, at 5:00 pm. The agenda for that meeting has been publicly posted on BoardDocs, and can be accessed through this link below.\n \nhttps://go.boarddocs.com/oh/tsdoh/Board.nsf/Public\n \nAfter we open the meeting, we will move into Executive Session, during which we will discuss the applications. No vote will be taken during the Executive Session, we will simply be sharing our perspectives and discussing the merits of the applicants. When we reconvene in open session, we will welcome visitors and have public participation. As usual, public participation will be limited to 30 minutes total, with 3 minutes for each speaker. After public participation, one of two possibilities will emerge:\n \n\nIf a board member would like time to gather more information, they may make a motion to schedule a second Special Session. If the motion is seconded, it would proceed to a vote, and if a majority agrees, then a date and time for a second Special Session will be determined, and the meeting will adjourn.\n\n \n\nIf a second Special Session is not moved, seconded, and voted in the affirmative, then the Board will begin a process of moving to accept an appointment of a specific applicant. This may involve a series of possible motions as we work through the list of applicants. For example, if the first applicant on the list doesn’t receive a motion, or receives a motion but doesn’t receive a second, or receives a motion and a second but does not receive a majority of the votes, then we will move to the next applicant on the list. This will proceed until an applicant receives a majority of the vote of the board members, at which point the process will end and the appointment completed. \n\n \nIt may also be the case that we are able to bring forth from Executive Session a limited number of applicants, rather than work through the entire list of 16 names.\n \nIf no applicant receives a majority of the vote, then we would proceed to scheduling another Special Session. Be aware that an appointment requires a majority vote, not a unanimous one.\n\nIn addition, applicants are welcome to attend the meeting on Monday, but it is not required of any applicant to be present. If an appointment is made at the Monday meeting and the applicant chosen is in attendance, it may be possible to proceed with the swearing in of the newly appointed member at that time. If the appointed member is not present, they will be sworn in later in the week or early the next week. State law allows that the swearing in of a board member is not required to take place in a public meeting as long as it is conducted by an official who is authorized to do so. Mrs. Tafelski, the Treasurer, is such an official. By state law, this appointment must be made by October 9, which is the 30-day limit to complete the process. \n \nTSD Board of Education",

COVID-19 is in our community, state, nation, and world.  If your child becomes ill during the day, we will call you.  We also continue to use the CARES room, use additional cleaning protocols, separate people as much as possible, and assist our families with COVID-19 information and directions from BCHD.  We have had many students quarantined that were exposed but have never developed any symptoms or become positive, yet have had to miss school.  We also have students and staff members who live with a positive person and have become positive within the 1-10 day timeframe.  We will need to work with you for a careful balance.  We do not want an outbreak and we want to keep our schools open.  These procedures could change again, as we have witnessed throughout the pandemic.  We will keep you informed as we receive new or updated information from health officials.  Please contact our nurses and administrators if you have any questions.\nIn Education,\nDr. Edward Theroux\nTalawanda Superintendent",

COVID-19 is in our community, state, nation, and world.  If your child becomes ill during the day, we will call you.  We also continue to use the CARES room, use additional cleaning protocols, separate people as much as possible, and assist our families with COVID-19 information and directions from BCHD.  We have had many students quarantined that were exposed but have never developed any symptoms or become positive, yet have had to miss school.  We also have students and staff members who live with a positive person and have become positive within the 1-10 day timeframe.  We will need to work with you for a careful balance.  We do not want an outbreak and we want to keep our schools open.  These procedures could change again, as we have witnessed throughout the pandemic.  We will keep you informed as we receive new or updated information from health officials.  Please contact our nurses and administrators if you have any questions.\nIn Education,\nDr. Edward Theroux\nTalawanda Superintendent",
